Project 2

For this project, we implemented 6 different classes.

Point.java
This class consists of the fundamentals of what makes a point, that is, the x and y coordinates which are used to create one line
It also consists of methods that check whether a point is to the left or the right with respect to another line

Line.java
This class consists of methods that fundamentally make a line. The Line consists of two points and these are the ones that make up a line
The class also contains a wide array of methods whose functionality is well explained in the class itself,
One of the most important however is the compareLines methods which takes in points and checks whether or not they are lines

MyTreeNode.java
This has been used in the previous lab(Lab10). It basically contains data and the children as well as the root.
 Please refer to the readme file for more info on its functionality.
 
myBST.java
This is the tree itself

TesterClass.java
This class contains few methods. 
It has Graphical User Interface for this project adn also contains a method to read from the textFile
Lines are being inserted here and the comparison of the lines is also made here



Running of the program
Compile them and then run TesterClass.java on terminal by typing java TesterClass ReadFile.txt
The result should be a couple of red lines on a blue rectangle(EXTRA CREDIT)
Think of the rectangle as a unit square so we managed to scale our lines and the rectangle so that it looks like that!!! 
Click between two lines, click inside a region bounded by lines, and check the console
It should display "points bounded by the same region" if they are in the same region of lines
Or "points are separated by a line" if they are not in the same region
Also try to put your own lines(within the unit square) as we designed it-20 points



Thanks
