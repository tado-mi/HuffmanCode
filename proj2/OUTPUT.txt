The average path length to the external nodes as required by the project is printed as well as the preorder version of the tree

In the last line, you will see the result of whether or not points are on the same line based on how you clicked it


The avg path iss 3.0
(0.0, 0.12)(0.23, 1.0)
(1.0, 0.41)(0.0, 0.52)
(1.0, 0.2)(0.3, 1.0)
(0.0, 0.4)(0.1, 0.0)
(1.0, 0.35)(0.1, 1.0)
The point one has values 0.196 0.146
The point two has values 0.044 0.094
(0.0, 0.12)(0.23, 1.0)
(1.0, 0.41)(0.0, 0.52)
(0.0, 0.4)(0.1, 0.0)
(1.0, 0.35)(0.1, 1.0)
(1.0, 0.35)(0.1, 1.0)

(1.0, 0.2)(0.3, 1.0)
(1.0, 0.35)(0.1, 1.0)
(1.0, 0.35)(0.1, 1.0)
The line separating the two points have end points :(0.0, 0.4) and (0.1, 0.0)
